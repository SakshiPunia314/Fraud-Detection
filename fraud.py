"""***Answers to task questions***

1. **Data cleaning (Missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity)**
Answer: The code includes steps for:
Missing values: Checking and handling missing values.
Outliers: Detecting outliers in numerical columns using Z-score.
Multi-collinearity: Checking for multi-collinearity using a correlation matrix and calculating VIF.
2. **Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration**
Answer: The model used is a Random Forest classifier, which is described briefly as a supervised machine learning algorithm known for handling class imbalance and non-linear relationships. The code includes the steps for training and evaluating this model.
3. **How did you select variables to be included in the model?**
Answer: The variables were selected based on domain knowledge (e.g., amount, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig) and were further refined through feature importance ranking from the Random Forest model. Additionally, categorical variables like type were encoded using one-hot encoding.
4. **Demonstrate the performance of the model by using the best set of tools**
Answer: The performance of the model is demonstrated using tools such as:
Confusion matrix: To evaluate true positives, false positives, etc.
Classification report: To assess precision, recall, F1-score.
AUC-ROC score: To evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between fraud and non-fraud transactions.
5. **What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customers?**
Answer: The feature importance output from the Random Forest model is used to identify key factors such as amount, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, and type of transaction. The most predictive features are ranked based on their importance in the model.
6. **Do these factors make sense? If yes, how? If not, how not?**
Answer: The factors identified in the feature importance ranking make sense:
Amount: Fraudulent transactions often involve abnormally high or low amounts.
Transaction type: Fraud tends to occur in specific types of transactions (e.g., transfers or cash outs).
Balance differences: Sudden large changes in balances could signal fraud.
7. **What kind of prevention should be adopted while the company updates its infrastructure?**
Answer: Recommendations for infrastructure updates include:
Real-time monitoring: To flag suspicious activities instantly.
Two-factor authentication: To secure high-risk transactions.
Transaction limits: To prevent large, rapid transfers that may be fraudulent.
Data encryption: To ensure secure transactions.
8. **Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?**
Answer: To measure the effectiveness of these actions:
Monitor fraud rates: Before and after implementation.
Evaluate model performance: Using confusion matrices and classification reports after implementing infrastructure changes to check for improvements.
Customer feedback and audits: Ensure customers are satisfied with the security changes, and conduct regular audits to assess system effectiveness.
